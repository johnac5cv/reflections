What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
"git init" creates a hidden file ".git" in a normal directory. That file holds the metadata necessary for git to handle the directory as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A Working directory, even if identified as a repository, may contain untracked files (as shown by git status). "git add" registers files in .git, placing them into a staging area, awaiting the commit step to actually place them into the repository.

git commit (with no arguments) starts up the associated text editor to more easily create a commit description. Add the description, save the file, and exit the editor to complete the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
git diff --staged will show changes stages but not yet committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
branches help try out major changes without affecting the master branch, until you're ready to try a merge with the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It shows parents, and which the commit history, and which commits are not reachable by virture of being branched off the master branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Combing the changes AND the history of he changes
